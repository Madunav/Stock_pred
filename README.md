I conducted thorough Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to prepare the data for predicting whether tomorrow's opening price would surpass or fall below yesterday's closing price. I utilized the yfinance library to access and retrieve historical market data, focusing on the S&P 500 index for our market predictions. The data underwent rigorous cleaning and manipulation to ensure its cleanliness and stability for modeling purposes, including addressing null values. 

To identify significant features and key performance indicators (KPIs) for stock market prediction, I employed a Random Forest algorithm. Additionally, considering the temporal nature of the data, I implemented a basic ARIMA model to enhance prediction accuracy.
